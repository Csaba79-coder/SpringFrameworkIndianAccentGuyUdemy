Under src there are resources folder, and there you can find application.properties

'''
SpringProfile

There are 3 environments:

1. development
2. production
3. test

'''
There are 5 profiles:

- book
- grocery
- dev
- test
- prod


So we would like to use SMTP mail sender in production environment, and the MOCK mail sender in development!

So for this reason add @Profile("dev") to mock mail sender! And this means you can use this one in development environment!

You may find in txt file the required codes and fields for sending email!

Do not forget maven dependency:
