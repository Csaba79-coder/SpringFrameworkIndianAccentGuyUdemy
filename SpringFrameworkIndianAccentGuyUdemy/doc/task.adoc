The problem I had in pom.xml:

This one fixed the problem, version was missing:

Under src there are resources folder, and there you can find application.properties

In this one you can set the properties like localhost, domain, password, etc. and check under HelloController how to get the values!


'''
SpringProfile

There are 3 environments:

1. development
2. production
3. test

'''
There are 5 profiles:

- book
- grocery
- dev
- test
- prod


So we would like to use SMTP mail sender in production environment, and the MOCK mail sender in development!

So for this reason add @Profile("dev") to mock mail sender! And this means you can use this one in development environment!
